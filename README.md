# LedApp
Mobile app to control leds

## About
A mobile application that runs on android smartphones. This application is used to run led patterns using simple bluetooth communication with the software [Arduino Led Controller](https://github.com/M4zek/ArduinoLedController). It works but unfortunately it was designed in a specific way so it will need rebuilding in the future. It supports running all the patterns implemented in the aforementioned software.

## Futures
- Launching several patterns of led bar
- History of message exchange
- Automatic switching of led tape
- Different settings of the application or led strip
